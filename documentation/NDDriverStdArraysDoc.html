    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</a> <a href="areaDetector.html">
      areaDetector</a> driver that allows any EPICS Channel Access client to create
    NDArrays in an areaDetector IOC. It is the logical inverse of the <a href="NDPluginStdArrays.html">
      NDPluginStdArrays</a>, which converts NDArrays in an IOC into standard EPICS waveform
    records for use by Channel Access clients. The NDPluginStdArrays plugin also writes
    to additional records to describe the array structure. The NDDriverStdArrays driver
    receives EPICS waveform records from Channel Access clients and converts them to
    an NDArray in the IOC. The clients must also write to additional EPICS records to
    define the structure of the NDArray. It is similar in concept to the <a href="pvaDriverDoc.html">
      pvaDriver</a> which receives EPICS V4 NTNDArrays over the network and converts
    them to NDArrays in the IOC. pvaDriver only works with EPICS V4 PVAccess clients,
    while NDDriverStdArrays works with EPICS V3 Channel Access clients.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDDriverStdArrays is based on an earlier driver called ADSoft written by David Vine
    from LBNL. This driver generalizes ADSoft to support any number of dimensions and
    any input waveform data type.</p>
  <p>
    One use-case for this driver may be to receive data from the EPICS sscan record.
    By putting such data into an areaDetector IOC it could then be saved with the standard
    file saving plugins. It could also be processed with ROI plugins, and then visualized
    with the standard areaDetector viewers like ImageJ.</p>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to this driver. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_driver_std_arrays.html">
      NDDriverStdArrays class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <p>
    The driver receives 1-D arrays, normally from an EPICS waveform record. The NDimensions
    record controls the actual number of dimensions to use when creating the NDArray.
    The Dimensions array record controls the actual size of each of the NDimensions
    dimensions. The only limit on the number of dimensions is the ND_ARRAY_MAX_DIMENSIONS
    value defined in ADCore. This is normally 10. The ColorMode record can be used to
    define the color mode (Mono, Bayer, RGB1, RGB2, or RGB3) of the NDArray. This does
    not affect the operation of the driver, so the data in the waveform record must
    be in the correct order for the specified color mode.</p>
  <p>
    The data type of the NDArray is controlled by the DataType record. It can be any
    of the datatypes Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Float32, or Float64.
    The datatype (FTVL) of the EPICS waveform record can also be any of the types CHAR,
    UCHAR, SHORT, USHORT, LONG, ULONG, FLOAT, or DOUBLE. The DTYP of the waveform record
    can be any of asynInt8ArrayWfOut, asynInt16ArrayWfOut, asynInt32ArrayWfOut, asynFloat32ArrayWfOut,
    or asynFloat64ArrayWfOut. The driver does any required type conversion between the
    waveform record data and the NDArray data.</p>
  <p>
    The driver has 2 modes of operation, AppendMode=Disable and AppendMode=Enable. When
    AppendMode is Disable then each write to the waveform record will generate a complete
    NDArray. The first element of the waveform record will be placed in the first element
    of the NDArray. Generally the number of elements written should be equal to the
    total number of elements in the NDArray. If it is greater then excess elements will
    be discarded. If it is fewer then the NDArray will be zero-padded.</p>
  <p>
    When AppendMode=Enable then the waveform record can contain just part of the NDArray
    data, and data can be appended by multiple writes to the waveform record to construct
    the complete NDArray. In append mode the following records are used to control the
    operation of the driver. These records have no effect if AppendMode=Disable.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>NewArray This record must be processed before sending data for a new NDArray.</li>
    <li>NextElement This record can be used to define the location in the NDArray in which
      to write the data on the next waveform record write. It is set to 0 when NewArray
      is processed, and is incremented by the number of elements in the waveform record
      each time the waveform record is written. Thus if the data are being written in
      the logical order of the NDArray then this record does not need to be written. This
      record is useful when the should not be written in the natural order of the NDArray
      data.</li>
    <li>Stride This record can be used to define the increment in the NDArray index for
      each successive element in the waveform record. Data is copied from the waveform
      record to the NDArray as follows:
      <pre>
        NDArray[NextElement + i*Stride] = waveform[i]
    </pre>
      The default value of Stride is 1.</li>
    <li>ArrayComplete This record must be processed to tell the driver that the NDArray
      is complete and that no more waveform records will be written to this NDArray.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The CallbackMode record controls when the driver does callbacks to plugins. In append
    mode it may not be desireable to do callbacks each time the waveform record is written,
    since that could happen thousands of times per second if only small parts of the
    NDArray are written on each call. The CallbackMode record has 3 choices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OnUpdate The callbacks will be done each time the NDArray is updated, i.e. each
      time the waveform record is written.</li>
    <li>OnComplete The callbacks will be done when the NDArray is complete. This is equivalent
      to OnUpdate when AppendMode=Disable, but when AppendMode=Enable then the callbacks
      will only happen after the ArrayComplete record is processed.</li>
    <li>OnCommand The callbacks are only called when the DoCallbacks record is processed.
      This allows Channel Access clients to control when the callbacks are done. The DoCallbacks
      record will also cause the callbacks to be done when CallbackMode is OnUpdate or
      OnComplete.</li>
  </ul>

    The following table describes how the NDDriverStdArrays driver implements some of
    the standard driver parameters. The Acquire, ImageMode, NumImages, ImageCounter,
    and ArrayCallbacks records are handled in the standard way. The trigger, temperature,
    acquire time, and gain related records are not implemented.

    test_NDDriverStdArrays.py contains the following tests:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>testDataTypes</b> This test creates NDArrays of size 256x768 for each allowed
      NDArray data type and corresponding Python data type. It writes the complete array
      with a single channel access write to the waveform record, i.e. with AppendMode=Disable.
      After writing each array it reads it back to verify that the data read matches the
      data written. </li>
    <li><b>testDataTypesAppend</b> This test is the same as testDataTypes except that
      the data are written with AppendMode=Enable. Each channel access write to the waveform
      record writes "ystep" rows of the image. "ystep" is set to 1 in the code, but can
      be edited to test writing multiple rows at once. After writing each complete array
      it reads it back to verify that the data read matches the data written. </li>
    <li><b>testContinuousMono</b> This test writes 50 NDArrays of size 500x800 with ImageMode=Continuous,
      ColorMode=Mono, and AppendMode=Disable. The images are a 2-D damped sine wave, where
      the frequency increases with each successive image. After writing each complete
      array it reads it back to verify that the data read matches the data written.
    </li>
    <li><b>testContinuousRGB1</b> This test writes 20 NDArrays of size 3x600x800 with
      ImageMode=Continuous ColorMode=RGB1, and AppendMode=Disable. The images are a 2-D
      damped sine wave, where the frequency increases with each successive image and where
      the red, green, and blue images have different frequencies. After writing each complete
      array it reads it back to verify that the data read matches the data written.
    </li>
    <li><b>testScanPoint</b> This test simulates collecting 2-D scan data for 4 detectors
      with size 100x200. The data are collected with AppendMode=Enable. The data are appended
      to the NDArray one "pixel" at a time, i.e. the waveform record is has 4 elements,
      one for each detector. At the end of the scan the test configures the ROI1: plugin
      to select each of the 4 detectors in turn and processes the DoCallbacks record.
      This can display each of the detectors in succession in the ImageJ plugin, for example.
    </li>
    <li><b>testScanPointReverse</b> This is the same as testScanPoint except that the
      data are collected in reverse order, i.e. from element [99,199] backwards to element
      [0,0]. It thus tests the use of NextElement.</li>
    <li><b>testScanLine</b> This test simulates collecting 2-D scan data for 4 detectors
      with size 400x600. The data are collected with AppendMode=Enable. The data are appended
      to the NDArray one "detector line" at a time, i.e. the waveform record is has 400
      elements, containing the data for one detector for one row of the scan. The NDArray
      can be one of the following shapes:
      <ul>
        <li>[4,400,600] This is "detector interleaved&quot;, and called detIndex=0.&nbsp;
          This is the default.</li>
        <li>[400,4,600] This is "row interleaved", and called detIndex=1.</li>
        <li>[400,600,4] This is "plane interleaved", and called detIndex=2.</li>
      </ul>
      At the end of the scan the test configures the ROI1: plugin to select each of the
      4 detectors in turn and processes the DoCallbacks record. This can display each
      of the detectors in succession in the ImageJ plugin, for example.
      <li><b>testScanLineIndex1</b> This is the same as testScanLine, but with detIndex=1.
        <li><b>testScanLineIndex2</b>This is the same as testScanLine, but with detIndex=2.
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following shows the NDPluginROI medm screen configured to select the 4'th detector
    in the NDArray. Note that the plugin has the CollapseDims PV enabled. This results
    in output arrays of dimensions [100, 200], rather than [1, 100, 200] which would
    be the case if CollapseDims was disabled.</p>

    The following shows the ImageJ screen displaying the output of the 4'th detector
    via ROI4. The NDPluginStdArrays was set to have ROI4 as its array input.</p>
